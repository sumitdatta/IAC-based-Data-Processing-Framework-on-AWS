# IAC based Data Processing Framework leveraging AWS Services
What problem are we solving here? 

Suppose, you are generating lot of data, either on Shop floor or in a Factory or in a consumer device. And you want to process the data, at a location close to where the data is being generated or somewhere in the AWS cloud. But it is easier said than done. What should your data architecture look like? Which all AWS services should you use? Which AWS API/SDK should you learn in order to use these services? How would you setup your AWS Infrastructure.

Phew !! There are too many questions to answer.

Our data processing framework, using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), sets up a reference architecture on AWS. Using just one click. There is no need for you to know about AWS APIs, SDKs etc. Instead, you can focus on writing business logic to process your data using programming language of your choice. And the framework transparently executes it wherever you want, either on cloud or near the data source. The framework brings all of your data to AWS data analytics platform so that you can create dashboards etc. according to your business needs.
